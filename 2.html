          <h2>javaScript</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
            conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
            often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
            curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
            object-orientation, and first-class functions.

          <h2>Go</h2>
          <p>
            Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at
            Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is
            syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage
            collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency

          <h2>python</h2>
          <p>
            Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming
            language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability
            with its notable use of significant indentation.

          <h2>C#</h2>
          <p>
            C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language
            encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped,
            imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and
            component-oriented programming disciplines.

          <h2>C++</h2>
          <p>
            C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne
            Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with
            Classes".
